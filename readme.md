#Project Euler

So, I want to become a better programmer and have a little space to prove it.

This project is just a collection of my solutions to [Project Euler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/).

Everything runs in Node with the Harmony flag.

##Run

Want all answers?

```
npm start
```

Want the answer to a problem?

```
node --harmony src/index.js --problem=N
```
