#Project Euler

So, I want to become a better programmer and have a little space to prove it.

This project is just a collection of my solutions to [Project Euler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/).

Everything runs in Node with the Harmony flag (I like arrow functions).

##Zen

I code with [Atom](https://atom.io/) and a few packages for formatting and color, but:
- No autocomplete.
- No debugger.
- No IDE.
- No linting.

My results so far have been a better ability to understand problems, to solve them and I rely a lot less in the IDE. When I do rely in IJ or Xcode, it's because I'm going faster than I should, not that it's going fast for me. ðŸ‘Š

##Run

Want all answers?

```
npm start
```

Want the answer to a problem?

```
node --harmony src/index.js --problem=N
```
